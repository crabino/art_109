        <p class = "text">  Today I went into the internet and haven't been on it much these past few days. I've been busy living my life in new LA trying out some new fabricated meat(fabmeat). Shit pretty good but Grandpa Z wasn't a fan of it and said he missed the taste from the old world but honestly I just think he’s hating cause he doesn’t enjoy the fact that the chiefs had some Chrome implants but whatever I’m going through my day going into the net. As per usual I had first had to link to the netwave from my home point on the net luckily I caught a wave as soon as I linked into the stream. Back when this shit was mad diff from what gramps told me the connection point was from screens instead of e-ports. Kinda crazy but I guess that makes sense but now I can’t imagine not being able to directly connect to the wave being able to do it for so long. I did my usually check social hubs to see what’s up trying to low-key don’t want seem desperate but I also really meets some people I could be doing outside but eh less work its right here plus I can meet some interesting people outside New Cali especially with how we got some wars or something but whatever. Nothing is popping at the moment. I decided to try to see if any of my RL friends are down to go surf through the wave, none were available, guess I’m doing this on my own time. The system added some new locations but right now I don’t really care about them. Its government paid and most likely spied on a lot of main web like that. I can't really get behind that apparently that always has been the case but since a person is directly integrated with the web it feels extra bit personal. So I gotta try to find something outside the govern section but I gotta be careful, there are a lot of crack-codes and trojs(trojan virus) around from what my gramps said were these viruses . A lot of people die from interacting with those things, it fucks up your internal chip and causes the user to have permanent  brain damage and eventually something called, “wave craze”, leading to people to go crazy and off themselves or others around them. The UN made sure to mitigate the interaction out of bounds exploration to professionals but it is still pretty accessible if you know where to go plus its where all the cool shit is. 
Usually there's some backend location that leads out to the unsanctioned parts of the web so I should be able to find my way out. I think it's weird to think that internet wasn’t always a place but something people used to connect through machine I guess since I am so integrated to this is the new norm but I wonder how things back then it must of been so hard without everything being in me, life better in living in the wave, no? Anyway I got to see a lot of random old sites left behind. It feels like I'm traveling abandoned ruins though it is hard to navigate. This old code feels like I'm walking through some mud or whatever that white stuff is from the old movies ‘snow’ or whatever. I tried climbing up to get a vantage point and saw a lot of old code roaming around nothing out of the ordinary but I think they might start a coding tsunami, better steer clear of that. I went to head down and lost my footing and I fell. Landed bad I hate the pain but at least gone when I unlink. I ran back to the entrance I came from but I got swept up by the code but I was able to grab to the edge of the entrance and was able to pull myself back. I snuck back with no issue but that was a bit close and could end up wave crazed. I logged out and got my food from the door and sat down. I wasn't really hungry after that. I went on a walk. You know it gets harder for me to differentiate life and the web. The web feels almost the same but better my legs don’t get tired, I have energy, I don’t feel like I do right now. Saying all that I can’t really understand that right now I prefer this more. I think…
