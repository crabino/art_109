Through my artistic journey I would look at video as my main course as an artist. It was primarily what I went to school for but as I continue as a student I yearn to attempt more fantastical ideas and I felt like a lot of my current work went into 3d projects. I believe this will become my focal point in future. I feel that the idea of 3d as a space allows me to create scenes and environments that I want to explore. I want to create something gross, maybe a little scary and I feel like I can push the boundaries of what I can do to the physical form that I can’t reasonably do through just video production. I have 4 projects to showcase: Loop, Camera Shy, Still Life and Crude Heart. These four pieces showcase a variety of different disciplines, The main goal of these pieces vary in artistic meaning.
	Loop itself was created through illustration vectors, I was primarily made to showcase my competence on after effects and explore options of UX icon design.  Camera Shy is a short film created by combining a lot of my skill set using different adobe products and blender and it is primarily a horror film trying to emulate a game. Still Life was a creation in blender with two characters. It is more fan art than anything else. Crude Heart was a ugly and unappealing heart made in blender mainly to symbolize the idea of a person who has no good qualities to them and the heart itself is affected by that. Then my newest project, Ouroboros is an expression of my journey as an artist and what I want to tackle more in the future. I want to use imagery of horror aesthetics and gross visuals to tell stories. I believe that there is beauty in many forms and to explore that through nasty, raunchy, ugly visuals will always appease me more than something that is conventionally beautiful.
